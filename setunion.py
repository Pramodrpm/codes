Set1 = {1, 'pramod','is'}
Set2 = {'2', 'good', 'boy'}
n = Set1.union(Set2)
print(n)


output:{'od', 1, 'boy', 'good', 'pram', '2'}


his code defines two sets Set1 and Set2, and then takes their union using the union method.
The result is a new set n containing all the elements from both sets.
