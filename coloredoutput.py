/*This is a Python code that uses the colorama module to print text in different colors in the console.
The Fore class in the colorama module provides a set of constants that represent different foreground colors.
The + operator is used to concatenate the color constant with the text to be printed.
In this code, the text "hello world" is printed four times, each time in a different color: green, red, yellow, and blue.*/
