my_list=["python","coder"]
for i in my_list:
    my_list.append(i.upper())
print(my_list)


output: infinite loop

This code will result in an infinite loop because the loop is iterating over my_list and appending new elements to it during each iteration.
Therefore, the length of my_list keeps increasing and the loop never ends.
