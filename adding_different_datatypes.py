def fun():
    return "little"+' '+"dog"
print(fun(),sep='')




The code defines a function called fun that takes no arguments and returns the string "little dog".

When the function is called with fun(), the returned string "little dog" is printed to the console because there is no explicit return statement.

The sep='' argument passed to the print function doesn't have any effect in this case because there is only one argument to print.
The sep parameter specifies the separator character to use between arguments in the print function. Since there is only one argument, no separator is needed.
